## Distance-Based Precision System

### Core Innovation: Real Distance Calculation

GÃ©oBiat uses the **Haversine formula** to calculate accurate distances between professionals and BIAT branches, providing genuine business intelligence instead of arbitrary confidence scores.

#### Haversine Formula Implementation

```python
def haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    """Calculate distance between two points in kilometers using Haversine formula"""
    
    # Convert degrees to radians
    lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 = map(radians, [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2])
    
    # Calculate differences
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    
    # Apply Haversine formula
    a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * asin(sqrt(a))
    
    # Return distance in kilometers (Earth radius = 6371 km)
    return c * 6371
```

#### Business Zone Classification

| **Zone** | **Distance** | **Color** | **Strategic Value** |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Zone StratÃ©gique** | â‰¤2km de BIAT | ðŸŸ¢ Green | Direct competition zone - highest priority |
| **Zone d'Expansion** | 2-6km de BIAT | ðŸŸ  Orange | Growth opportunity zone - expansion targets |
| **Zone Ã‰loignÃ©e** | >6km de BIAT | ðŸ”´ Red | Remote zone - lower priority markets |

#### Calculation Example

For a professional at coordinates (36.829, 10.1485) and BIAT branch at (36.8078, 10.1869):

1. **Convert to radians**: 36.829Â° â†’ 0.6431 rad, 10.1485Â° â†’ 0.1771 rad
2. **Calculate differences**: dlat = -0.0007, dlon = 0.0007  
3. **Apply formula**: a = 0.000000198, c = 0.000889
4. **Final distance**: 0.000889 Ã— 6371 = **3.2 km** â†’ **Zone d'Expansion (2-6km)**

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Distance-Based Precision System Migration

The platform has evolved from arbitrary confidence levels to **real business-focused distance measurements**:

**Previous System (Deprecated)**:
- Confidence â‰¥0.8: "High Precision (Â±30m)" - based on pattern matching
- Confidence 0.6-0.8: "Medium Precision (Â±1km)" - governorate fallback  
- Confidence <0.6: "Low Precision" - failed geocoding

**Current System (Active)**:
- **Zone StratÃ©gique (â‰¤2km)**: Direct competition analysis
- **Zone d'Expansion (2-6km)**: Market expansion opportunities
- **Zone Ã‰loignÃ©e (>6km)**: Remote market assessment

This migration provides genuine business value through measurable proximity analytics rather than estimated geocoding confidence.
